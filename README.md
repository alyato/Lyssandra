### Sparse Coding algorithms


Sparse coding is a class of unsupervised methods for learning sets of over-complete dictionaries to represent data efficiently.
Each signal can be expressed as a sparse linear combination of the atoms in the dictionary:

To encode a set of datapoints `X` over a dictionary `D`:

```python
from lyssa.sparse_coding import sparse_encoder

# ...
se = sparse_encoder(algorithm='bomp', params={'n_nonzero_coefs': 5}, n_jobs=8)
Z = se.encode(X, D)
```

Some of the supported solvers include:

   - Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)
   - Batch OMP [1]
   - Group OMP [2]
   - Non-Negative OMP [3]
   - Iterative Hard Thresholding

### Dictionary Learning algorithms

Learning the dictionary from the data involves solving the following objective

A dictionary learned from image patched of natural images looks like

Supported solvers:
   - K-SVD and its approximate variant [4]
   - Online Dictionary Learning [5]
   - Projected Gradient Descent

### Feature Extraction
   - Spatial Pyramid Matching using Sparse Coding [6]
   - Convolutional Feature Encoders [8]
   - Dense SIFT extraction

### Classification
   - Label Consistent K-SVD [9]
   - Sparse Representation based Classification [10]



## Installation ##

Install the dependencies using:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


For LASSO problems, the Python version of SPAMS http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/index.html
must be installed in your system.


First edit config.yml to specify the
* workspace path, the location of the directory in which outputs of feature extraction tasks will be saved
* path to OpenBLAS in your system (optional)

and then do:

    pip install .

For best performance, configuring numpy with [OpenBLAS](https://www.openblas.net/) is recommended (see `Dockerfile`).

## Usage ##
Have a look at the `lyssa/examples` folder for some usage examples, and typical workflows.
